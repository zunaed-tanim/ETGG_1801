● Built-in functions
● Expressions
● Variables
● Debugging
Lab

[Requirements]

This lab will be worth 100 points in total. There will only be 80 points worth of the lab assigned.
Students must utilize skills learned and expand upon them to gain the remaining 20 points. Students
that go above and beyond expectations may gain an additional 10 points for creativity.
Naming conventions are expected to be followed. Failure to do so results in a loss of points.

[Steps]

1. [5] Create a .py file using your IDE. (YourNameLab02.py)
2. [10] Add a comment to the top of the file with the following.
○ #Course ID.Section
○ #First & Last Name
○ #Lab Number & Name
○ #Date: Date Created
3. [10] Using the print function, output an ASCII art picture:
○ Use a single print statement per line.
○ Must contain a minimum of 5 lines.
○ Must use at least two different types of escape sequences.
4. [15] Using the print function, output an ASCII art picture.
○ Use a single print statement for the entire image.
○ Must contain at least 5 lines.
○ Must contain multiple escape sequences.
5. [35] Utilize keyboard input and variables to create an interactive health bar.
○ Create the following variables.
■ barLength (How many characters wide the bar is.)
■ currentHealth (How much health our player currently has.)
■ maxHealth (Tthe maximum health the player can have.)
○ Draw an ASCII representation of the health bars with the variables given.
■ The user must give input for each variable.
■ Use barLength to create the border size.
■ Use currentHealth and maxHealth to calculate how full the bar is.
■ Use the print function to output the results.
6. [5] Halt the program until the user presses return/enter.
7. [20] - Expand & experiment upon this script.
8. [10] - Go beyond by being creative.
